## Process Manager

### A simple web app for monitoring cron jobs

Have your cron jobs call a url within process manager whenever they finish their run, if they stop checking in
an alert is recorded and emails are sent out.

This is meant as a single tenant hosted application, ideal for running within a company.

Login is via usernames and passwords or alternatively via Github with the option to restrict to a particular organisation.
